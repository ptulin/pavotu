    <p class="page-subtitle">Rethinking digital presence</p>

    <p>Lord Abbett, one of the oldest mutual funds companies, needed a digital overhaul. They approached HNW, agency that specialized in High New Worth clients and for which I was leading UX team, for advice and help.</p>
    <p>After initial assessment, we realized complexity of the project. With millions of active users, many of them with dramatically different needs, with several third party vendors interfacing in real time with data, we had quite complex task on our hands. This project took about two years and about 7000 pages of documentation to complete. You can visit Lord Abbett <a href="https://www.lordabbett.com/en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> to see the results.</p>

      <h3>Information Architecture review</h3>
      <p>We needed to think about transition from the old system. After careful user research and analytics review, many brainstorming sessions and prototype testing, we have simplified and organized navigation around user priorities rather than based on content. The goal was not to surprise user with a new navigation but rather to introduce a well thought through modifications to an existing system. This also was a consideration for keeping the budget of the project in check.</p>

      <h3>Dealing with data</h3>
      <p>We needed to accommodate a lot of data. Working closely with the client team and interviewing a lot of users, we defined a new data hierarchies bringing to the front most important information. Additionally, our design needed to accommodate required number length and provide clear indicators of change. We also added variations in data being shown to different user groups.</p>

      <h3>Tying it all together</h3>
      <p>We designed this system for expansion. In order to help our client to manage the system after we finished, we have designed and built a robust Component Object Library where treatment of all design object was described in hierarchical system both from UX and also technical point of view.</p>

      <h3>Adding Mobile</h3>
      <p>To add to the overall user experience we designed several apps for different user groups like individual investors or financial advisers. One of the problems we had to solve doing that was continuity of experience across devices, especially in relation to financial transactions.</p>
