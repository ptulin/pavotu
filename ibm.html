    <p style="color:var(--color-muted); line-height:1.8; margin-bottom:2rem;">
      As an Experience Director I worked on several IBM projects. One of the most interesting was project internally called BlueDot. It was meant as a support mobile app designed for helping business user to navigate IBM cloud services, especially the tool called Bluemix. Project quickly extended to additional devices and features and it was done together with IBM Watson team. Project was done with a particular IBM flavor of Agile. The kickoff doc can be seen <a href="https://www.pavotu.com/ibm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

      <h3>Working with IBM Agile</h3>
      <p>IBM had it's own special agile flavor. Most of the decisions were done by the team and sketched on the whiteboards. Those were later photographed and annotated and served as a working documentation. In this way we could work fast and reach consensus quickly. We would also save a lot of time and budget on producing documentation. Later I would use those photos to produce basic documentation of the project mostly for archiving purposes. Most of the effort was actually put towards making a working prototype.</p>

    <div class="content-block">
      <h3>Styling with CSS</h3>
      <p>Again, to save time we defined a number of styles that can be applied to the prototype being built. This required close collaboration between programmers and designers from very early stages. By applying different CSS to a prototype in progress we could early test and get feedback from stakeholders and users. Any required changes were applied on fly.</p>
