    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>When one of the clients of Havas, where I worked as an Experience Director, approached us to convert one of their websites to a responsive version, the ask was to do it in the most efficient way. That meant reusing content and code whenever possible. I was able to re-purpose about 90% of the content and about 70% of the old code — and the whole project was done within weeks.</p>

    <h2>Invest in Users, Not in Devices</h2>
    <p>After analyzing site traffic I quickly identified patterns in user behavior. Most users would either use a desktop version or phone, with a small percentage accessing via a tablet. Another observation was that while most first-time users would often come from a phone device, the majority of returning users would view the site on larger screens.</p>
    <p>Therefore, I proposed skipping the tablet version entirely, which significantly reduced development costs.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Grids, Layouts and Content</h2>
    <p>The next step was to analyze all layouts, grids and content and decide which elements to keep and which needed to be redesigned and re-coded. After several brainstorming sessions with coders we decided to move the website to a 12-column grid. That allowed for maximum content and code reuse. We also reviewed all content to make it more relevant to new users (on mobile) and returning users (mostly desktop).</p>

    <h2>Mobile Second</h2>
    <p>In this project we actually created the mobile version after the desktop — because we wanted to reuse as much content as possible, and our primary target user group were returning users who would usually access the site on desktop. After revising navigation and information architecture, we defined how much content would display on the mobile version, allowing users to quickly scan on a small screen and return for an in-depth visit on a larger device.</p>

    <h2>The Results</h2>
    <p>Due to delivering the first project in a record amount of time and under budget, our client quickly asked for several similar projects. These were also done in record time and on budget — which resulted in GlaxoSmithKline officially recommending this method of responsive treatment to all their vendors globally.</p>
