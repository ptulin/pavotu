    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>The Children's Place is one of the biggest brick-and-mortar and online children's clothing retailers — a leading specialty retailer catering to kids from newborn to age 14. Our goal was to improve the mobile experience. At the same time, we had to conduct the whole operation with minimal disruption to the operations of the website.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Project Scope</h2>
    <p>The project was mainly focused on improving user journeys, product find-ability and user retention programs. Working with the client team, we identified key pain points in the mobile shopping experience and designed targeted improvements that could be implemented without a full platform rebuild.</p>
    <p>The result was a significantly improved mobile shopping experience that maintained operational continuity and met the client's timeline and budget requirements.</p>
