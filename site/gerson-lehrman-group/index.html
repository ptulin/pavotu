    <h2>About the Client</h2>
    <p>GLG is one of the top and biggest expert networks in the world. If you need to find a very obscure piece of information, you would probably reach out to GLG. As UX Lead I worked on several projects, doing everything from research to design and overseeing more junior team members.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>A Lot of Obscure Workflows</h2>
    <p>Connecting experts with clients requires extra diligence when it comes to financial and legal compliance. Therefore we needed to implement some fairly complex workflows into the system. The challenge was to make them simple enough so the user could confidently follow them — reducing errors without requiring extensive training.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Complex Search Queries</h2>
    <p>One of the core elements in the GLG system is an internal search engine called Mosaic. Search results would be collected from several internal and external data sources all over the globe and presented in a way that showed relations in a very graphical and easy-to-understand way.</p>
    <p>I was responsible for designing a rather complex search interface that would allow consultants to find the only two experts in the world on a specific subject — within minutes.</p>
